SwayEcosystem
--------------------------------------------------
I made this because I reinstall often and want to 
have a laptop function perfectly in very few steps.
I will automate as much of the post install setup
as possible, but there are some hardware specific 
settings that may have to be configured manually. 

This config requires
--------------------------------------------------
base
base-devel
wpa_supplicant
dialog
git
ufw
sway
xorg-server-xwayland
termite
swaylock
swayidle
python-pywal
grim
intel-ucode
light
neofetch
fzf
pulseaudio
