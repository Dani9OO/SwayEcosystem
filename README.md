Unicorn Sway
--------------------------------------------------
This is a fork of [SwayEcosystem](https://github.com/cyberrumor/SwayEcosystem), the major changes is that I use
wpgtk instead of just wal to be able to theme GTK windows as well as
the icons to the color of a selected background

Some other changes include
--------------------------------------------------
- Including stuff from [Numenra's Dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/numenra/dotfiles) such as
- - Kitty terminal configuration
- - Waybar
- Removed Mako notifications temporarily while I design some better looking ones
