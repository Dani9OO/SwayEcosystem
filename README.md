Unicorn Sway
--------------------------------------------------
This is a fork of [SwayEcosystem](https://github.com/cyberrumor/SwayEcosystem), the major changes is that I use
wpgtk instead of just wal to be able to theme GTK windows as well as
the icons to the color of a selected background

Some other changes include
--------------------------------------------------
- Including stuff from [Numenra's Dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/numenra/dotfiles) such as
  - Kitty terminal configuration
  - Waybar
- Removed Mako notifications temporarily while I design some better looking ones

How to use setup scripts
--------------------------------------------------
You'll first need to clone this repository, after that, thanks to the awesome job of cyberrumor it'll be just as easy as running these commands within the folder of this cloned repository

- sudo sh RootSetup.sh
- sh UserSetup.sh
